Microservices architecture is growing in popularity among businesses as a way to enhance application development and delivery, according to Gartner.
One key insight from Gartner is that microservices can help organizations become more agile by breaking down monolithic systems into smaller, more manageable components. This permits shorter development and deployment cycles and more flexibility when modifying or updating particular services.
Gartner warns that adopting microservices can be difficult due to the need for specialist skills and equipment as well as the potential for additional complexity. To decide whether to implement a microservices architecture, Gartner urges enterprises to thoroughly analyze their use case and goals.
